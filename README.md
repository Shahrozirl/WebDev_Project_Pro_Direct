Dear Client,

Our team has completed the updates for more accessibility for people with visual impairment or blindness.

Requirements:
We previously already added a generic verdana font style for easier readability across all types of people.

Website Description:
Just a quick overview of the website:
The site is designed to help people find great snow sport and winter travel locations. The style is clean and bright, with snowy mountain images to match the theme. The Home page welcomes visitors and introduces the idea behind Snow Trails. The About page explains the purpose of the project and shares a little background about the founder, Luke Snow. The Contact page gives users a simple way to get in touch for help or questions.

Modifications:
1. Alt text included in all images to make sure screen readers have a more descriptive meaning of the image. Examples: Logo: “Snow Trails Travel Agency logo”.
2. Navigation and footer are now properly seperated from main container for screen readers.
3. Ensured one <h1> per page and logical subheadings (<h2>, <h3>). Examples: Home page: main title set as <h1> (“Welcome! Fellow Snow Sport Enthusiasts”). About page: <h1>About Snow Trails</h1> with subsections like “MEET THE AUTHOR” and “PROUDLY SPONSORED BY” as <h2>.
4. all link has text describing where it will lead, (e.g., “Home”, “About”, “Contact Us” rather than “Click here”).

Extra Feature:
5. The above are all modified changes to previous code, we decided to add an extra feature which are two buttons on the bottom-right of the screen that will allow the user to increase/decrease font-size as required (for people with visual impairment compared to full blindness).

Our website is noe hosted online and you can access the website here: "https://shahrozirl.github.io/WebDev_Project_Pro_Direct/"
