Dear Client,

Our team has completed the updates for more accessibility for people with visual impairment or blindness.

Requirements:
We previously already added a generic verdana font style for easier readability across all types of people.

Website Description:
Home Page

Modifications:
1. Alt text included in all images to make sure screen readers have a more descriptive meaning of the image. Examples: Logo: “Snow Trails Travel Agency logo”.
2. Navigation and footer are now properly seperated from main container for screen readers.
3. Ensured one <h1> per page and logical subheadings (<h2>, <h3>). Examples: Home page: main title set as <h1> (“Welcome! Fellow Snow Sport Enthusiasts”). About page: <h1>About Snow Trails</h1> with subsections like “MEET THE AUTHOR” and “PROUDLY SPONSORED BY” as <h2>.
4. all link has text describing where it will lead, (e.g., “Home”, “About”, “Contact Us” rather than “Click here”).

Extra Feature:
5. The above are all modified changes to previous code, we decided to add an extra feature which are two buttons on the bottom-right of the screen that will allow the user to increase/decrease font-size as required (for people with visual impairment compared to full blindness).

Our website is noe hosted online and you can access the website here: "https://shahrozirl.github.io/WebDev_Project_Pro_Direct/"
